class Trough(Mode):
    """Manages trough by providing the following functionality:

        - Keeps track of the number of balls in play
        - Keeps track of the number of balls in the trough
        - Launches one or more balls on request and calls a launch_callback when complete, if one exists.
        - calls a launched_callback when all pending balls have actually made it to the shooter lane
        - Auto-launches balls while ball save is active (if linked to a ball save object
        - Identifies when balls drain and calls a registered drain_callback, if one exists.
        - Maintains a count of balls locked in playfield lock features (if externally incremented) and adjusts the count of number of balls in play appropriately.  This will help the drain_callback distinguish between a ball ending or simply a multiball ball draining.

        Changes beyond the standard PyProcGame Trough:
            - supports autoplunge (see :meth:launch_and_autoplunge_balls()) if 'plunge_coilname' is provided to init()
            - tries to ensure a ball has successfully escaped the shooter lane before plunging another (see 'shooter_lane_inactivity_time')
        
        Notes: launch_callback is set either by reaching into the trough object and setting it,
            OR by passing a callback as a parameter to :meth:launch_balls().  Note the only
            way to _clear_ that callback is by reaching into the trouch object and setting it to None.

            This callback is useful for setting up ball save timer starts and what-not.  Note that
            for multiball, you probably want a different ball saver set up if you support autoplunge.
            (ball save with autoplunge vs. without)

            again, launched => got to the shooter lane
                    launch => intent to send to the shooter lane

    Parameters:

        'game': Parent game object.
        'position_switchnames': List of switchnames for each ball position in the trough.
        'eject_switchname': Name of switch in the ball position the feeds the shooter lane.
        'eject_coilname': Name of coil used to put a ball into the shooter lane.
        'early_save_switchnames': List of switches that will initiate a ball save before the draining ball reaches the trough (ie. Outlanes).
        'shooter_lane_switchname': Name of the switch in the shooter lane.  This is checked before a new ball is ejected.
        'drain_callback': Optional - Name of method to be called when a ball drains (and isn't saved).  
        'shooter_lane_inactivity_time':Optiona: - The amount of time the shooter lane should turn inactive for
            to imply a ball has been successfully launched and is away (i.e., failed plunge takes less than this time)
        'plunge_coilname': Optional - Name of a coil to be fired to autoplunge a ball if launch_and_autoplunge_balls() is called.
