# This is a modified version of OSC Mode that supports sending lamp updates to the graphical
# OSC client. This has been modified from an earlier version written by Brian Madden.  
# Unfortunately, this version has not been generated from Brian's latest version, and as 
# such some functionality from his latest is likely to be missing in this version.

# Coupled with the latest Graphical OSC 'switchMatrixClient' you can layout lamps on an 
# image of the playfield and  watch lamp updates during FakePinPROC (or live) machine testing.

# This version will respond to an OSC request of /lamps/get and it will return OSC messagess
# consisting for each of the lamps and their respective state (0=off, 1=on).  

# This is NOT an efficent way to do this.  I will, eventually, provide an OSC message to
# specify the lamp ordering so the reply message can be a single message with the state of
# all lamps (and drastically reduce overhead), but this is enough to get people started... I hope.
