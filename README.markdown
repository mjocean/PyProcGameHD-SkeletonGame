SkeletonGameDMD is a fork of [PyProcGameHD-SkeletonGame](http://skeletongame.com/) which is itself a fork of [pyprocgame](http://pyprocgame.pindev.org/).

pyprocgame is a Python-based programming framework that can be used to code custom rules for pinball machines powered by either the P-ROC or P3-ROC, available from [Multimorphic](https://www.multimorphic.com/)

PyProcGameHD-SkeletonGame augments pyprocgame with support for traditional PC display hardware (i.e., LCD) for high-resolution, full-color display via SDL2/OpenGL based hardware acceleration (PyProcGameHD) and tries to reduce the amount of code you have to write to create a new game with 'typical components' (via SkeletonGame). Traditional DMD screens are no longer supported.

SkeletonGameDMD keeps all features of PyProcGameHD-SkeletonGame and adds back support for monochome DMD screens driven by the P-ROC.

Please see the [Official PyProcGameHD/SkeletonGame website](http://skeletongame.com/) site for the all-in-one installer, programming help, and assorted documentation.

## DMD Support

To enable the display on the DMD driven by the P-ROC controller, set the following options in config.yaml

    ```
    proc_dmd: True
    dmd_dots_w: 128
    dmd_dots_h: 32
    ```

See ./EmptyGameDMD for an example of very simple game using a physical monochrome DMD driven by the P-ROC controller, from which to start a new game.
In particular, EmptyGameDMD shows how to configure the lower resolution ScoreDisplay and a very simple attract mode formatted for the size of the DMD.
